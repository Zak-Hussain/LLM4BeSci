"Middle East respiratory syndrome. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (also known as MERS or MERS-CoV) is a rare but severe respiratory illness. It can start with a fever and cough, which can develop into pneumonia and breathing difficulties. MERS was first identified in 2012 in the Middle East and is most common in that region. The risk of infection with MERS to people in the UK is very low. How do you catch MERS?MERS is spread between animals and people. There's evidence that camels in the Middle East are the main source of the virus. MERS can also be passed from person to person through cough droplets. But it doesn't seem to be very contagious between people unless they're in close contact.     There have been 5 cases of MERS in the UK since 2012. The most recent case was identified in August 2018, with previous cases diagnosed in 2012-13.Symptoms of MERSSymptoms include:fevercoughdifficulty breathingdiarrhoea and vomitingYou should call your GP or NHS 111 if you have symptoms and believe you could have caught the infection – for instance, if you have recently been to the Middle East or have been in contact with someone with a confirmed infection.Treatment for MERSThere's no specific treatment for MERS. Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms. Around 36 to 40% of people who get MERS die as a result of the infection.   Advice to travellers going to the Middle EastAll travellers, particularly those with long-term medical conditions, should practise good hygiene. This means regularly washing your hands with soap and water, especially after visiting farms, barns or market areas. You should also:avoid contact with camelsavoid raw camel milk and/or camel productsavoid eating or drinking any type of raw milk, raw milk products, and any food that may be contaminated with animal secretions, unless it's been peeled and cleaned and/or thoroughly cooked Advice to travellers returning from the Middle EastIf you develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing within 14 days of returning from the Middle East, you should get medical advice. Call NHS 111 or your GP.",29.09090909
"Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body.The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells, known as lymphocytes.In Hodgkin lymphoma, B-lymphocytes (a particular type of lymphocyte) start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.The most common symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.Read more about the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma.",16.11111111

"Neuroendocrine tumours and carcinoid syndrome. Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare tumours of the neuroendocrine system, the system in the body that produces hormones. They can be cancerous or non-cancerous.The tumour usually grows in the bowels or appendix, but it can also be found in the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, kidney, ovaries or testicles. It tends to grow very slowly.Neuroendocrine tumours are sometimes referred to as carcinoid tumours, particularly when they affect the small bowel, large bowel or appendix.Carcinoid syndrome is the collection of symptoms some people get when a neuroendocrine tumour, usually one that has spread to the liver, releases hormones such as serotonin into the bloodstream.About 2,900 people are diagnosed with a neuroendocrine tumour each year in the UK, but not everyone with a tumour will have carcinoid syndrome.Cancer Research UK has more information about different types of neuroendocrine tumours.",33.55555556

"Alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria, or ""black urine disease"", is a very rare inherited disorder that prevents the body fully breaking down two protein building blocks (amino acids) called tyrosine and phenylalanine.It results in a build-up of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body. This can turn urine and parts of the body a dark colour and lead to a range of problems over time.Amino acids are usually broken down in a series of chemical reactions. But in alkaptonuria, a substance produced along the way, homogentisic acid, cannot be broken down any further. This is because the enzyme that normally breaks it down does not work properly. Enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen. One of the earliest signs of the condition is dark-stained nappies, as homogentisic acid causes urine to turn black when exposed to air for a few hours.If this sign is missed or overlooked, the disorder may go unnoticed until adulthood, as there are usually no other noticeable symptoms until the person reaches their late 20s to early 30s.",44.09090909

Many do realise they have a problem but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it.It's really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their difficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems but also pose a health and safety risk.

They start suddenly in children, with the child quickly becoming pale and listless, and often feeling sick and vomiting.Children also generally recover very quickly.

The expectation to talk to certain people triggers a freeze response with feelings of panic, like a bad case of stage fright, and talking is impossible.In time, the person will learn to anticipate the situations that provoke this distressing reaction and do all they can to avoid them.However, people with selective mutism are able to speak freely to certain people, such as close family and friends, when nobody else is around to trigger the freeze response.
